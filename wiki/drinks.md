## Recipes

After making each drink in a *Perfect* way, each recipe will still use the listed materials and money. Only the minigame
part can be skipped with auto-crafting.

## Quality

Depending on your skill and choices, the quality of the drink will vary. Creating a *Perfect* drink gives you the ability to later
create that drink automatically, without having to play the minigame. To create a perfect drink, you need to score *Great!* in all
three parts of drink creation.

| Rating  | Pouring Water               | Adding Ingredients                           | Stirring                                        |
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Come On | Note ends on the black area | Using 2 wrong ingredients                    | Almost constant “Too Fast/Slow”                 |
| Good    | Note ends on the grey area  | Using 1 wrong and 1 correct ingredient       | “Nice Stirring Speed" with some “Too Fast/Slow” |
| Great!  | Note ends in the gold area  | Using 2 correct ingredients                  | Almost constant “Nice Stirring Speed”           |

Since stirring speed is the only part of the minigame that requires some skill, it's the part that's most likely to fail. Thankfully,
the game is rather forgiving, so seeing some prompts about wrong stirring speed or incorrect direction is fine and will result with a *Great!*
anyway, as long as it's quickly corrected.

Stirring doesn't need to follow the arrows either. It's easier to spin circles in the middle of the screen.
